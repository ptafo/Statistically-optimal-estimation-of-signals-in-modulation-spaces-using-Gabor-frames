## Statistically-optimal-estimation-of-signals-in-modulation-spaces-using-Gabor-frames

# Real data simulation
Two mono WAV files of piano recording: a single-key press and a melody, sample at 44.1 Khz. White gaussian noise is then added to obtain a various signal-to-noise ratio,-10,1,10 and 100. Denoising was then apply using the universal threshold. We present results for the denoising with gabor frames(\alpha ) ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=A%20-%20B%20=%20\{x%20\in%20\U%20\mid%20x%20\in%20A%20\land%20x%20\notin%20B%20\})
