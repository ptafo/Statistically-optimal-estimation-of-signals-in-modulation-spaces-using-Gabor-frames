## Statistically-optimal-estimation-of-signals-in-modulation-spaces-using-Gabor-frames

# Real data simulation
Two mono WAV files, a piano recording and a blackbird recording from xenocanto both sampled at 44.1 kHz. White gaussian noise is then added to obtain a various signal-to-noise ratio,-10,1,10 and 100. Denoising was then apply using the universal threshold. We present results for the denoising with gabor frames using a gauss function as well as level 4 b-splines as window function. The results can be compared to wavelet shrinkage method using the biorthogonal B-splines of level 4(bior4.4) . The parameters are chosen according to our publication.
